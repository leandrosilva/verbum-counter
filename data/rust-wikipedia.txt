Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety, especially safe concurrency.[16][17] Rust is syntactically similar to C++,[18] and provides memory safety without using garbage collection.

Rust was originally designed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions from Dave Herman, Brendan Eich, and others.[19][20] The designers refined the language while writing the Servo layout or browser engine,[21] and the Rust compiler. The compiler is free and open-source software dual-licensed under the MIT License and Apache License 2.0.

Rust has been the "most loved programming language" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey every year since 2016.[22]
